### An open letter to the mayor of NYC

![](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/3-killed-in-wrong-way-crash-in-queens.jpg?resize=1536,1024&quality=75&strip=all) Dear Mayor Adams,

My name is \${letterAuthor}, a resident of \${authorNeighborhood} and I am writing this letter to raise concern about the high number of car crashes in New York City that have resulted in injuries or deaths. Based on 2020 data gathered from NYC Open Data, it's clear that this is a pressing issue that needs immediate attention. The following are some startling statistics from the data:

**33,442** crashes in 2020 that resulted in either injury or death. Of these, - **9,137** crashes were attributed to *driver inattention/distraction* - **1,414** crashes were attributed to *unsafe speed* - **532** crashes were attributed to *alcohol involvement*

A breakdown of where the crashes occurred:

| Borough       | Number of Crashes with Injury or Death |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Brooklyn      | 7,468                                  |
| Queens        | 5,632                                  |
| Bronx         | 3,997                                  |
| Manhattan     | 3,002                                  |
| Staten Island | 685                                    |
| NoData        | 12,667                                 |

This shows a news segment covering a crash in the Bronx on June 18th, 2020. The recklessness of the driver is clear and displays the need for something to be done about this issue.

To address this, I urge the city to consider stricter traffic enforcement, improved road infrastructure, and/or public awareness campaigns.

[Vision Zero](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/vision-zero-safe-driving.shtml), the city's current citywide initiative to eliminate death and serious injuries from traffic incidents, isn't enough.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

\${letterAuthor}
