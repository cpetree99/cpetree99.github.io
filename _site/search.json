Based on 2020 data gathered from NYC Open Data, it‚Äôs clear that this is a pressing issue that needs immediate attention. The following are some startling statistics from the data:\n33,442 crashes in 2020 that resulted in either injury or death. Of these, - 9,137 crashes were attributed to driver inattention/distraction - 1,414 crashes were attributed to unsafe speed - 532 crashes were attributed to alcohol involvement\nA breakdown of where the crashes occurred:\n\n\n\nBorough\nNumber of Crashes with Injury or Death\n\n\n\n\nBrooklyn\n7,468\n\n\nQueens\n5,632\n\n\nBronx\n3,997\n\n\nManhattan\n3,002\n\n\nStaten Island\n685\n\n\nNoData\n12,667\n\n\n\nThis shows a news segment covering a crash in the Bronx on June 18th, 2020. The recklessness of the driver is clear and displays the need for something to be done about this issue.\n\n\nTo address this, I urge the city to consider stricter traffic enforcement, improved road infrastructure, and/or public awareness campaigns.\nVision Zero, the city‚Äôs current citywide initiative to eliminate death and serious injuries from traffic incidents, isn‚Äôt enough.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,"
