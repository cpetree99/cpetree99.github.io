Based on 2020 data gathered from NYC Open Data, it‚Äôs clear that this is a pressing issue that needs immediate attention. The following are some startling statistics from the data:\n33,442 crashes in 2020 that resulted in either injury or death. Of these, - 9,137 crashes were attributed to driver inattention/distraction - 1,414 crashes were attributed to unsafe speed - 532 crashes were attributed to alcohol involvement\nA breakdown of where the crashes occurred:\n\n\n\nBorough\nNumber of Crashes with Injury or Death\n\n\n\n\nBrooklyn\n7,468\n\n\nQueens\n5,632\n\n\nBronx\n3,997\n\n\nManhattan\n3,002\n\n\nStaten Island\n685\n\n\nNoData\n12,667\n\n\n\nThis shows a news segment covering a crash in the Bronx on June 18th, 2020. The recklessness of the driver is clear and displays the need for something to be done about this issue.\n\n\nTo address this, I urge the city to consider stricter traffic enforcement, improved road infrastructure, and/or public awareness campaigns.\nVision Zero, the city‚Äôs current citywide initiative to eliminate death and serious injuries from traffic incidents, isn‚Äôt enough.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,"

    "text": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset is sourced from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and is available on the NYC Open Data platform. This dataset provides detailed information on motor vehicle collisions reported to the NYPD across New York City. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage.\nThe entire dataset, which spans a decade, has 2.16 million entries. Therefore, only crash data from the year 2020 was extacted and downloaded in CSV format, resulting in 113,173 entries. After converting to points in ESRI‚Äôs ArcGIS Pro, only those crashes that resulted in injury or death were extracted, which shrunk the data to 33,442 points, a more manageable size.\nThe following table explains each column of the original dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nColumn Description\n\n\n\n\nCOLLISION_ID\nUnique record code generated by system\n\n\nACCIDENT_DATE\nOccurrence date of collision\n\n\nACCIDENT_TIME\nOccurrence time of collision\n\n\nBOROUGH\nBorough where collision occurred\n\n\nZIP_CODE\nPostal code of incident occurrence\n\n\nLATITUDE\nLatitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326)\n\n\nLONGITUDE\nLongitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326)\n\n\nLOCATION\nLatitude , Longitude pair\n\n\nON_STREET_NAME\nStreet on which the collision occurred\n\n\nCROSS_STREET_NAME\nNearest cross street to the collision\n\n\nOFF_STREET_NAME\nStreet address if known\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_PERSONS_INJURED\nNumber of persons injured\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_PERSONS_KILLED\nNumber of persons killed\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_PEDESTRIANS_INJURED\nNumber of pedestrians injured\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_PEDESTRAINS_KILLED\nNumber of pedestrians killed\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_CYCLISTS_INJURED\nNumber of cyclists injured\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_CYCLISTS_KILLED\nNumber of cyclists killed\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_MOTORISTS_INJURED\nNumber of vehicle occupants injured\n\n\nNUMBER_OF_MOTORISTS_KILLED\nNumber of vehicle occupants killed\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_1\nFactors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_2\nFactors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_3\nFactors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_4\nFactors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle\n\n\nCONTRIBUTING_FACTOR_VEHICLE_5\nFactors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle\n\n\nVEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_1\nType of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other)\n\n\nVEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_2\nType of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other)\n\n\nVEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_3\nType of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other)\n\n\nVEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_4\nType of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other)\n\n\nVEHICLE_TYPE_CODE_5\nType of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other)"
